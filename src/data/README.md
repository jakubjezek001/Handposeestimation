# Datasets
The datasets are stored in `/data` directory. Following are the description and source of the datasets.

- STB: https://jianbojiao.com/pdfs/icip.pdf (Very easy, "solved", pushing better accuracies on this dataset is not worth it in my opinion. Still a good enough to train on)
- RHD: https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/projects/hand3d/ (Synthetic, average sample quality, first paper to tackle monocular RGB and proposed a synthetic dataset alongside it)
- HO-3D: https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01481 (Newer dataset, hand+object interaction, good sample quality, one of the target datasets. Evaluated online)
- freiHAND: https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/projects/freihand/ (Newer dataset, hands, sometimes with object interaction, multiple views. One of the target datasets. Evaluated online)
